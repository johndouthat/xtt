      <li>Congratulations, you're the proud owner of a new account. Where to start?</li>

      <li>
        <h3>Philosophy</h3>
        <p>The important thing to remember is that time is always ticking.  No matter what you're doing,
        there she is, in the background, patiently waiting for you to notice her again.</p>
      </li>
  
      <li>
        <h3>1. Create some projects</h3>
        <p>You'll want to create some projects, in order to start recording your time.  You may have
          two, five, or even ten projects.  Each project gets a short code you can use in your status
          messages to assign work to that project.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <h3>2. What are you working on?</h3>
        <p>Now you record your current status and assign it to a project; or if there's no project
        (such as "commuting", or "sleep") you just don't assign a code.</p>
  
        <div class="example">
          <pre><code>Grocery shopping</code></pre>
          <pre><code>@test Writing code for ticket #34</code></pre>
        </div>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <h3>3. Become a power user</h3>
        <p>Add your AIM username to your profile, and add <b><%= Xtt.config['aim_username'] %></b> to your AIM buddies (ichat, adium).</p>
        <p>Ask <%= Xtt.config['aim_username'] %> for <b>help</b>, for your list of <b>projects</b>, available <b>commands</b>, or your
        current <b>status</b>.  <%= Xtt.config['aim_username'] %> can also take your status updates.
        </p>
      </li>
      
      <!-- todo: contexts -->

      <li>
        <h3>4. Invite other users</h3>
        <p>You can invite other users to your project. Other people can only see your statuses on projects they share with you.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <h3>5. What's next?</h3>
        <p>Soon you'll be able to invite other users to your projects.</p>
        <p>We're working hard on integrating external sources of data; so, for example, reading RSS feeds of
          your SCM commit history; or to watch your AIM away status to automatically sign you out.
        </p>
        <p>Found a bug?  email <code><%= Xtt.config['email'] %></code>
